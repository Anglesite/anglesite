# @DWK

This is a directory for my `@dwk/` node modules.

## AI Setup

- TypeScript
- Jest @ 90% coverage
- Linting: Typescript/JavaScript, YAML, Markdown, HTML, CSS

## Vibing with Claude

Tell User Stories for new features. Show ad hoc wireframes from Freeform.

Pre-commit:

```text
1. Remove all code obsoleted by the changes since the last commit and any leftover debug logging.
2. Update existing tests for changed code.
3. Ensure we have 90% test coverage on the new code.
4. Check and fix any linting errors.
5. Add all changes and summarize them into a commit message for me to approve.
```

Double check linting and tests. Spot check changes in app.

### Phase 2: Remaining Work (60% incomplete)

üî¥ Critical Blockers (Fix First)

1. Missing Dependencies - Install @rjsf/\* packages to fix WebsiteConfigEditor
2. No File Editors - Zero WYSIWYG editors implemented (core Phase 2 feature)
3. IPC Integration Gap - React components can't actually edit/save file content

üìù Major Missing Features

WYSIWYG Editors (0% complete):

- Markdown editor with live preview
- HTML visual editor
- CSS editor with syntax highlighting
- SVG visual editor
- XML/data file editor

  Plugin System (0% complete):

- Angular-style API architecture
- Plugin registration system
- Extension point framework

  SEO & Accessibility (0% complete):

- Structured metadata generation
- Schema.org integration
- Social media card generation
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance tools
- Built-in accessibility auditing

  üîß Technical Gaps

  State Management:

- Expand React Context for file editing state
- Add undo/redo functionality
- Implement draft saving

  Integration:

- Make React editor primary (not fallback)
- Complete IPC handlers for file operations
- Add real-time preview sync

  üìä Current Status: 40% Complete
