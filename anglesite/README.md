## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- macOS (primary support), Windows, or Linux

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anglesite/anglesite.git
   cd anglesite
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the application:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Start Anglesite:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

### Creating a Website

1. Click **File → New Website** or use `Cmd+N`
2. Enter a name for your website (e.g., "portfolio")
3. Anglesite automatically:
   - Creates the website directory with starter content
   - Configures the domain (portfolio.test)
   - Updates /etc/hosts with biometric authentication (Touch ID/password)
   - Opens a dedicated editing window with live preview

### Multi-Window Editing

- **Dedicated Windows**: Each website opens in its own editing window
- **Context-Aware Menus**: Menu bar adapts based on focused window type
- **Website Management**: Right-click websites for rename/delete options
- **Window State Tracking**: Prevents duplicate windows, manages window focus

### Website Structure

Websites are stored in:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/Anglesite/websites/
└── your-site/
    └── index.md
```

Each website uses Markdown files that are automatically converted to HTML by Eleventy.

### Previewing Your Site

- **Local Preview**: Your site is available at `https://sitename.test:8080` (HTTPS mode) or `http://localhost:8081` (HTTP mode)
- **Live Reload**: Changes to your files automatically refresh the preview
- **DevTools**: Toggle developer tools with `Cmd+Option+I`
- **External Browser**: Open in your default browser with `Cmd+Shift+O`

### Building for Production

Click **Build** or use `Cmd+B` to generate the static HTML files. The built site will be placed in your website's directory.

### Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Launch the application
- `npm run build` - Build Eleventy sites
- `npm test` - Run Jest tests
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking

### Architecture

Anglesite uses a modern multi-process, multi-window architecture:

- **Main Process**: Manages application lifecycle, authentication, servers, and system integration
- **Multi-Window Renderer**: Dedicated windows for help and website editing
- **Biometric Authentication**: Touch ID integration with sudo-prompt for secure privilege escalation
- **DNS Management**: Cross-platform hosts file management with automatic cleanup
- **Certificate Management**: Self-contained CA with user keychain integration
- **Eleventy Server**: Serves website content with hot reload (port 8081)
- **HTTPS Proxy**: Provides SSL termination for .test domains (port 8080)
- **WebContentsView**: Secure preview integration with CSP compliance

For detailed architecture documentation with Mermaid diagrams, see [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Security

- **Local Only**: All servers bind to 127.0.0.1 (localhost only)
- **Modern Authentication**: Touch ID/biometric support with secure fallback
- **User Keychain**: CA certificates installed in user keychain (no admin required)
- **Privilege Escalation**: Uses sudo-prompt (replaced deprecated electron-sudo)
- **Sandboxed**: Websites isolated in application data directory
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP without unsafe-inline
- **Process Isolation**: Multi-process architecture with secure IPC
- **No External Access**: No network requests or telemetry
- **Automated Security**: Smart cleanup prevents orphaned system entries

## Troubleshooting

### Certificate Issues

If you encounter SSL certificate errors:

1. Open Keychain Access
2. Search for "Anglesite Development"
3. If found, delete it
4. Restart Anglesite to regenerate

### Hosts File Permissions

Updating /etc/hosts requires administrator privileges. Anglesite uses modern authentication:

- **Touch ID Support**: Biometric authentication on supported macOS systems
- **Intelligent Fallback**: Password prompt when Touch ID unavailable
- **Batch Operations**: Single authentication for multiple changes
- **Smart Cleanup**: Automatic removal of orphaned .test domains

You'll be prompted for authentication when:

- Creating a new website
- Starting the application (for automatic cleanup)
- Touch ID setup guidance provided if available but not configured

### Reset First Launch

To reset the first launch flow:

1. Quit Anglesite
2. Delete the settings file:

   ```bash
   rm ~/Library/Application\ Support/Anglesite/settings.json
   ```

3. Restart Anglesite
