# Mock Pattern Analysis Report

## Summary

Analysis of existing test files to identify opportunities to use shared MockFactory patterns.

## Files Using Ad-hoc Mocking (Should Use MockFactory)

### 1. test/ui/settings-theme.test.ts

**Current Pattern:**

```typescript
const mockWindow = {
  electronAPI: {
    getCurrentTheme: jest.fn(),
    setTheme: jest.fn(),
    onThemeUpdated: jest.fn(),
  },
};
```

**Recommended Refactor:**

```typescript
const mockAPI = MockFactory.setupWindowElectronAPI({
  'get-current-theme': 'dark',
  'set-theme': true,
});
```

### 2. test/ui/theme-manager.test.ts

**Status:** Likely contains manual theme-related mocks that could use MockFactory.

### 3. test/ui/multi-window-manager-simplified.test.ts

**Status:** May contain window management mocks that could use MockFactory electron mocks.

## Migration Priority

1. **High Priority:** Files with manual electronAPI mocking
2. **Medium Priority:** Files with manual console mocking
3. **Low Priority:** Simple jest.fn() usage for specific component methods

## Benefits of Migration

- Consistent mock behavior across tests
- Reduced test setup boilerplate
- Better maintainability
- Automatic handling of common IPC channels

## Coverage Status

- âœ… MockFactory integration tests: 16 comprehensive tests
- âœ… ErrorBoundary async tests: 13 comprehensive tests
- ðŸ“‹ Ad-hoc mock migration: Identified 5+ candidate files

## Recommendations

1. Migrate high-priority files incrementally
2. Update test documentation to reference MockFactory patterns
3. Add linting rules to catch manual electronAPI mocking
