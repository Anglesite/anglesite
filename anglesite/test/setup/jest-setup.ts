/**
 * @file Jest setup file that runs before all tests

 * This file imports custom matchers and performs any other

// Note: fs.promises.rm compatibility is now handled in the source code

// Note: Custom matchers and third-party mocks are imported in setupFilesAfterEnv
// This file only handles early module mocks that need to run before module loading

// Additional global setup can be added here if needed
