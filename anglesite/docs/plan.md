# Anglesite Project Plan

This document outlines the project plan for Anglesite, detailing the goals, scope, milestones, and strategies for its development as an open-source project.

## 1. Introduction

Anglesite is a local-first, Electron-based static site generator that combines the power of Eleventy with an intuitive desktop application experience. It democratizes website creation by providing both technical and non-technical users with a seamless local development environment featuring automatic HTTPS support, smart DNS management, and real-time preview capabilities.

## 2. Project Goals & Objectives

The primary goals of the Anglesite project are to:

- Provide a developer-friendly open-source foundation for static website creation.
- Enable contributions through a robust plugin system and modular architecture.
- Prioritize standards compliance, accessibility, and automation.
- Facilitate multi-platform distribution and syndication.

## 3. Scope

### 3.1. In Scope

The project will focus on delivering the core features defined in the product requirements, including standards-compliant output, extensible visual editors, a syndication engine, and a developer-focused publishing workflow.

### 3.2. Out of Scope

To maintain focus, the following are explicitly out of scope:

- **Full-blown CMS features:** Anglesite will not include user management or a built-in database.
- **Proprietary platform development:** The project will remain fully open-source.
- **"One-size-fits-all" solutions:** The architecture will prioritize modularity and extensibility over monolithic design.

## 4. Milestones & Deliverables

Development will proceed in a phased approach to ensure a stable and scalable foundation.

### Phase 1: Core Desktop Application ✅ **COMPLETED**

The MVP focused on delivering a fully functional desktop application with comprehensive local development features.

- **Completed Deliverables:**
  1. **Native Desktop App:** Full Electron application with native menu system
  2. **HTTPS Development Environment:** Automatic SSL certificate management with CA installation
  3. **Smart DNS Management:** Automatic .test domain configuration via /etc/hosts
  4. **Live Preview System:** Real-time preview with hot reload and WebContentsView
  5. **First Launch Flow:** Guided setup assistant for HTTPS/HTTP mode selection
  6. **Website Management:** Create, build, and preview websites with automatic domain setup

#### High-Level Task List (In Order)

1. **Foundation & Core Build Setup** ✅ **COMPLETED**
   - ✅ Initialize the Node.js project and install initial dependencies (11ty, TypeScript).
   - ✅ Establish the core directory structure (`src`, `dist`, `docs`).
   - ✅ Create a basic `.eleventy.js` configuration to build a single "Hello World" page.
   - ✅ Set up linting, formatting, and testing frameworks (e.g., ESLint, Prettier, Jest).

   **Lessons Learned:**
   - Used ESLint v8 instead of v9 due to compatibility issues with TypeScript and flat config

## 7. Risks & Mitigation

| Risk                         | Mitigation                                                                                                                                                    |
| :--------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Low Contributor Adoption** | Maintain high-quality documentation, a clear roadmap, and a welcoming environment. Actively engage with early contributors.                                   |
| **Scope Creep**              | Adhere strictly to the defined goals and phased rollout plan. Defer non-essential features to the post-MVP roadmap.                                           |
| **Technical Debt**           | Enforce strict TDD, linting, and code review processes. The modular plugin architecture helps isolate components and reduce complexity.                       |
| **Dependency Management**    | Rely on well-maintained open-source libraries. The plugin system allows for key components (like editors) to be swapped if a dependency becomes unmaintained. |
