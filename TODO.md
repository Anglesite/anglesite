# TODO: Anglesite

## Documentation

- [x] Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to new functions, especially in:
  - `anglesite/test/utils/mock-factory.ts` - Document all new utility functions ✅
  - `anglesite-11ty/plugins/rsl.ts` - Document RSL-specific types and functions ✅
  - React components that handle complex async operations ✅

## Code Quality

- [x] Replace console.log/warn/error with logger utility in production code:
  - `anglesite/src/renderer/ui/react/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` - ✅ Enhanced with logger + development-only console
  - `anglesite/src/renderer/ui/react/components/Main.tsx` - ✅ All console statements replaced with logger
  - `anglesite/src/renderer/ui/react/components/WebsiteConfigEditor.tsx` - ✅ All console statements replaced with logger
  - ✅ Added regression test: `test/regression/console-usage-regression.test.ts`

## Code Refactoring

- [x] Extract magic strings as constants:
  - `src/_data/website.json` path appears multiple times - create a constant
  - Default language 'en' appears in multiple places - centralize
  - Component names in error boundaries could be constants

## Testing Improvements

- [x] Add integration tests for the enhanced mock utilities - ✅ Created `test/integration/mock-factory-integration.test.ts` with 16 comprehensive tests
- [x] Verify all tests use the new shared mock patterns from `mock-factory.ts` - ✅ Analyzed existing patterns and documented migration opportunities
- [x] Add tests for error boundary behavior with async failures - ✅ Created `test/ui/react/ErrorBoundary.test.tsx` with 13 async failure tests

## Performance

- [x] ✅ Implemented request debouncing for IPC calls in WebsiteConfigEditor - Reduces IPC call frequency by 60-80% during rapid user interactions with 1-second debounce delay
- [x] ✅ Optimized lazy loading with granular chunk splitting - Split large forms chunk (1+ MB) into 4 focused chunks under 500KB each:
  - rjsf chunk (~400KB) - React JSON Schema Form libraries
  - ajv chunk (~300KB) - JSON Schema validation engine
  - mui chunk (~350KB) - Material-UI components
  - emotion chunk (~200KB) - CSS-in-JS styling engine

## Security Review

- [x] ✅ Audit all IPC channels for proper input validation - Created comprehensive IPC validation utilities with:
  - `src/main/security/ipc-validation.ts` - Complete IPC input validation framework
  - Input sanitization and type validation for all data types (strings, objects, arrays, URLs)
  - Path traversal prevention and absolute path blocking for file operations
  - Website name validation with alphanumeric patterns and length limits
  - File content validation with 10MB size limits and type checking
  - Character filtering and pattern matching security for page names and paths
  - URL protocol restrictions (http/https/file only) with malformed URL detection
  - Size limits and DoS protection mechanisms for arrays and large inputs
  - `createSecureIPCHandler()` wrapper for systematic validation integration
  - 22 comprehensive security tests covering all validation scenarios in `test/security/security-hardening.test.ts`
  - Performance testing ensuring validation completes under 100ms for 1000 operations
- [x] ✅ Ensure no sensitive data is logged to console in production builds - Implemented secure logging:
  - **Authentication Security**: Replaced Touch ID and password authentication console logs with secure debug logging in `dns/hosts-manager.ts`
  - **Certificate Validation**: Added path sanitization to certificate error logging in `main.ts`
  - **Module Import Security**: Implemented error sanitization for module import failures in `security/import-validator.ts`
  - **Path Sanitization**: Added `sanitize.path()` calls to remove usernames and sensitive directories from logs
  - **Error Sanitization**: Implemented `sanitize.error()` to redact tokens, keys, and passwords from error messages
  - **Production Safety**: Secure logging patterns ensure no authentication methods, system paths, or sensitive data exposure
  - **Development Support**: Maintains debugging capability through structured logging without exposing sensitive information

## Future Enhancements

- [-] Consider implementing a global error reporting service
  - [x] Write comprehensive unit tests for ErrorReportingService
  - [x] Update existing error handlers to report through the new service
  - [-] Add error reporting UI for administrators
    - [x] Module 1: ErrorDiagnosticsService - Core data management and real-time subscriptions
    - [x] Module 2: DiagnosticsWindowManager - Window lifecycle and IPC setup
    - [x] Module 3: Diagnostics IPC Handlers - Communication layer between main and renderer
    - [x] Module 4: React Components - UI components with Fluent design
    - [x] Module 5: Menu Integration - Help menu integration and keyboard shortcuts
    - [x] Module 6: Notification System - Critical error notifications and dismissal
- [x] Add telemetry for tracking component errors in production
- [x] Implement retry logic for failed IPC calls
- [x] Add user-friendly error messages for common failure scenarios
  - [x] Module 1: Error Message Catalog - 20 tests passing, 100% coverage
  - [x] Module 2: Error Translator - 35 tests passing, comprehensive edge case handling
  - [x] Module 3: useIPCInvoke Integration - Enhanced with `friendlyError` field
  - [x] Module 4: InlineError UI Component - Accessible, responsive error display
  - [x] WebsiteConfigEditor Integration - Displays user-friendly errors automatically
- [x] Fix Website Configuration editor: Failed to load configuration editor. Check console for details.
  - Root cause: InlineError component imported from main/core/errors/base.ts causing lazy-load failure
  - Solution: Created renderer-side type definitions (src/renderer/types/errors.ts)
  - Updated 3 files to use renderer types instead of main process imports
  - Added regression test to prevent future cross-process import issues
- [ ] Repeated log line: "Current website name for window: test"
- [ ] File Explorer should look like Xcode
