# AI Webmaster Agent - Story Split Plan

## Problem

Current Story 03 (AI Webmaster Agent) is rated at 13 points, which is very high-risk for MVP. The story covers too many features:
- Basic content editing
- Structural changes
- Design adjustments
- SEO optimization
- Technical operations

## Recommendation: Split into Two Stories

### Story 03a: AI Webmaster Agent - Basic Content & Editing (8 points)
**Priority:** P0 (Critical - MVP)
**Scope:** Core AI functionality for content creation and editing

**Includes:**
1. **Chat Interface** - User can interact with AI agent
2. **Context Building** - AI reads current page and site structure
3. **Content Creation** - Write/rewrite copy, generate headlines
4. **Content Editing** - Improve existing text, fix grammar, adjust tone
5. **Simple Structure** - Add/remove sections, basic layout changes
6. **Change Preview** - Show what AI will change before applying
7. **Apply/Undo** - User can approve or reject changes

**Excludes (moved to 03b):**
- Complex design changes (colors, fonts, components)
- SEO optimization features
- Multi-file/site-wide operations
- Advanced features (translations, batch operations)

**Points Breakdown (8 total):**
- Claude API integration and basic prompting: 2 points
- Chat UI and conversation management: 2 points
- Context building (page content only): 2 points
- Change preview and diff visualization: 2 points

### Story 03b: AI Webmaster Agent - Advanced Features (8 points)
**Priority:** P1 (High - Post-MVP)
**Scope:** Advanced AI capabilities for design, SEO, and site-wide operations

**Includes:**
1. **Design Adjustments** - Modify colors, fonts, spacing, layouts
2. **SEO Optimization** - Generate meta descriptions, alt text, structured data
3. **Multi-Page Operations** - Changes across multiple files
4. **Site-Wide Updates** - Update navigation, footers, global elements
5. **Advanced Prompts** - "Analyze my site and suggest improvements"
6. **Batch Operations** - Generate multiple blog posts, product pages
7. **Technical Features** - Add forms, configure redirects

**Points Breakdown (8 total):**
- Multi-file operation handling and validation: 2 points
- Design system integration (colors, fonts, components): 2 points
- SEO and structured data generation: 2 points
- Advanced context building (site-wide analysis): 2 points

## Benefits of Split

1. **Reduced MVP Risk**: 8 points is manageable, 13 is very risky
2. **Faster Time to Market**: Ship basic AI features first
3. **User Feedback**: Learn from basic features before building advanced
4. **Clearer Scope**: Each story has focused, achievable goals
5. **Better Testing**: Easier to test and validate smaller scope

## Dependency Relationship

Story 03a is **required** for Story 03b. The advanced features build on the basic chat interface, context building, and change preview system.

```
Story 03a (Basic AI)  -->  Story 03b (Advanced AI)
       ↓
   MVP Launch
```

## Updated MVP Calculation

**Old MVP:**
- P0 Stories: 48 points (including 13-point AI story)

**New MVP:**
- P0 Stories: 43 points (with 8-point basic AI story)
- Story 03b moves to P1 (Post-MVP)

**Timeline Impact:**
- Old: 48 points ≈ 5-6 weeks (2-person team)
- New: 43 points ≈ 4-5 weeks (2-person team)
- **Saves ~1 week on MVP delivery**

## Implementation Notes

### Story 03a Must Include
- Full chat interface (users can type prompts)
- AI can read current page content
- AI can suggest text/content changes
- User can preview and approve changes
- Basic undo/redo
- Error handling for API failures

### Story 03b Can Wait
- Color scheme changes
- SEO meta tag generation
- Multi-page operations
- Site-wide analysis
- Advanced prompts

## Recommendation

**Action:** Split Story 03 as outlined above.

**Result:**
- Safer MVP with more achievable scope
- Users still get valuable AI features in MVP
- Advanced features can be refined based on user feedback
- Faster path to launch

**Next Steps:**
1. Update Story 03 to reflect 8-point scope (03a)
2. Create new Story 14 for advanced AI features (03b)
3. Update README.md with new point totals
4. Update marketing requirements if AI was heavily featured
