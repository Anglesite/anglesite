# V-4.1: ActivityPub actor — design

Issue: [#363](https://github.com/Anglesite/Anglesite-app/issues/363) (part of epic [#338](https://github.com/Anglesite/Anglesite-app/issues/338), V-4 Federation + reader).

## Goal

Make a site a followable Fediverse actor: a Mastodon user can follow the site
and sees its posts. `@dwk/activitypub` (published `0.1.0-beta.5` on npm)
implements the actual ActivityPub protocol — inbox/outbox, follower
collections, HTTP Signatures, signed S2S delivery, all behind a per-actor
Durable Object. This app's job is composition: wire the package's declared
resources into the generated `wrangler.toml`, import it into the template's
`worker/worker.ts`, and let the existing generic Workers-tab toggle activate
it (its catalog binding is `settingsActivated`, the same mechanism
`@dwk/micropub` already uses — no new Settings screen needed just to turn it
on).

## Scope

**In scope:**

- Compose `@dwk/activitypub` into the per-site Worker (`wrangler.toml` DO
  binding + migration, `worker.ts` wiring) behind the existing Workers-tab
  toggle.
- Fixed single actor per site: username `"site"`, display name from
  `SiteSettings.displayName` (existing field, falls back to the site name), a
  generic fixed summary string. No new Settings field for identity.
- App-generated RSA keypair (2048-bit; PKCS#8 private / SPKI public PEM — the
  formats `@dwk/activitypub` requires for WebCrypto), persisted in Keychain
  per-site, pushed to Cloudflare as `AP_PRIVATE_KEY`/`AP_PUBLIC_KEY` secrets
  during provisioning.
- Micropub → ActivityPub fan-out: a successful Micropub **create** triggers an
  in-process call to the actor's owner-publish endpoint, so newly published
  posts land in the outbox as `Note` activities. This is what satisfies
  "sees posts" for this slice.
- `WorkersConformanceStatus.phaseRequirements[.v4]` already lists
  `@dwk/activitypub` — `WorkerActivation.conformanceAdvisory` covers it with
  no new code.

**Explicitly out of scope (tracked separately, not blocking this issue):**

- WebFinger (`.well-known/webfinger`, so `@user@domain` search resolves) —
  issue #364 / epic sub-task 4.4. Mastodon can still follow by pasting the
  actor URL directly into search, so this doesn't block acceptance here.
- Follower management UI — epic sub-task 4.2.
- Microsub reader — epic sub-task 4.3.
- Syncing a site's pre-existing content-collection posts (anything published
  before ActivityPub was activated, or authored outside Micropub) into the
  outbox — filed as [#926](https://github.com/Anglesite/Anglesite-app/issues/926)
  against epic #338. Materially bigger scope (a build/deploy-time content
  sync) than this slice.

## `@dwk/activitypub` contract (as published)

```ts
import { createActivityPub, ActivityPubObject } from "@dwk/activitypub";

const activitypub = createActivityPub({
  baseUrl: "https://example.com",
  actor: { username: "site", name: "...", summary: "..." },
  publicKeyPem: env.AP_PUBLIC_KEY,     // SPKI PEM
  privateKeyPem: env.AP_PRIVATE_KEY,   // PKCS#8 PEM, secret binding
  publishToken: env.AP_PUBLISH_TOKEN,  // optional: enables POST <actor>/outbox
  software: { name: "anglesite", version: "..." },
});

// GET  /users/site                      → actor document
// GET  /users/site/{outbox,followers,following}[?page=N]
// POST /users/site/inbox                → signed S2S delivery
// GET  /.well-known/nodeinfo, /nodeinfo/2.1
return activitypub(request, env, ctx);

export { ActivityPubObject };
```

Catalog entry (`catalog.json`, already published, no `requires`):

```json
{
  "id": "activitypub",
  "package": "@dwk/activitypub",
  "group": "social",
  "binding": { "kind": "settingsActivated" },
  "resources": [
    { "type": "durable-object", "binding": "ACTOR", "className": "ActivityPubObject", "sqlite": true }
  ],
  "routes": [
    { "path": "/users/", "match": "prefix", "methods": ["GET", "POST"], "head": true, "handler": "createActivityPub" },
    { "path": "/inbox", "match": "exact", "methods": ["POST"], "handler": "createActivityPub" },
    { "path": "/.well-known/nodeinfo", "match": "exact", "methods": ["GET"], "head": true, "handler": "createActivityPub", "authorityBound": true },
    { "path": "/nodeinfo/", "match": "prefix", "methods": ["GET"], "head": true, "handler": "createActivityPub" }
  ]
}
```

## Wrangler composition (new resource kind: Durable Objects)

Following the precedent `indieauth`/`webmention`/`micropub` already set —
bespoke binding names are part of a package's public composition contract, so
`WorkerComposition` keys off the catalog id directly rather than growing
`WorkerDescriptor.Resources`'s generic `needsD1`/`needsKV`/`needsR2` flags:

- Add `WorkerComposition.activitypubWorkerID = "activitypub"` and a
  `hasActivityPub` check, mirroring `hasWebmentionReceive`/`hasMicropub`.
- When active, `generateWranglerToml` emits:

  ```toml
  [[durable_objects.bindings]]
  name = "ACTOR"
  class_name = "ActivityPubObject"

  [[migrations]]
  tag = "v1"
  new_sqlite_classes = ["ActivityPubObject"]
  ```

- Route claims for `run_worker_first` come directly from the catalog's
  already-published `routes` array for `activitypub` — no new route-claim
  modeling needed (#746's machinery is already generic).

## `worker.ts` wiring

- New import block: `createActivityPub`, `ActivityPubObject`, and its config
  types from `@dwk/activitypub`, alongside the existing
  `@dwk/indieauth`/`@dwk/webmention`/`@dwk/micropub` imports.
- `export { ActivityPubObject };` — required so wrangler can bind the
  Durable Object class from this script.
- New `WorkerEnv` fields, all optional (matching every other worker's
  "degrade gracefully rather than throw" convention in this file):
  `ACTOR?: DurableObjectNamespace`, `AP_PRIVATE_KEY?: string`,
  `AP_PUBLIC_KEY?: string`, `AP_PUBLISH_TOKEN?: string`.
- `handleActivityPub`, following `handleMicropub`'s shape: 503 when
  `ACTOR`/`AP_PRIVATE_KEY`/`AP_PUBLIC_KEY` aren't all bound, otherwise
  `createActivityPub({...}).(request, env, ctx)`.
- **Route collision fix**: `@dwk/activitypub`'s catalog entry claims
  `POST /inbox` (its optional instance-level *shared inbox*), but that exact
  path is already claimed by this app's existing inbox-capture feature (#587,
  `WorkerComposition.inboxCaptureRouteClaim`, a public "visitor sends a
  message" form — an unrelated concept). Fix: pass `sharedInbox: false` to
  `createActivityPub`, so the package serves no `/inbox` route at all —
  federated inbound deliveries go to the actor-specific `/users/site/inbox`
  instead (equally valid ActivityPub, just forgoes an optional batching
  optimization for high-volume peers, irrelevant for a single-actor site).
  `worker.ts`'s `ROUTES` table therefore gets entries only for `/users/`
  (prefix), `/.well-known/nodeinfo` (exact), and `/nodeinfo/` (prefix) —
  never `/inbox`, which stays exclusively owned by `handleInbox`.

## Keypair generation & storage

The one genuinely new capability here — no prior secret in this app has
needed real key material, only opaque tokens/passwords.

Alongside the RSA keypair, `AP_PUBLISH_TOKEN` (gating the owner-publish
endpoint the Micropub fan-out calls) must also be an app-generated random
secret, not a hardcoded constant — the fan-out call and the endpoint it
targets live in the same open-source template shipped to every site, so a
literal token embedded in that source would be discoverable by anyone and
would let any outsider forge posts into any Anglesite site's outbox. It's
generated once per site (random bytes, base64url-encoded) the same way as
the keypair, and stored under its own Keychain account.

- New `AnglesiteCore` type (`ActivityPubKeyProvisioning`) using the Security
  framework (`SecKeyCreateRandomKey`, `kSecAttrKeyTypeRSA`, 2048-bit) to
  generate a keypair, then wrapping the raw PKCS#1 DER Security framework
  returns into the PKCS#8 (private) and SPKI (public) ASN.1 envelopes
  `@dwk/activitypub` requires for WebCrypto import. This is a standard
  fixed-prefix transformation for RSA (well-documented; not something Swift's
  Security framework does natively for export).
- Only the **private** key PEM is persisted; the public key is re-derived
  from it on demand (`SecKeyCopyPublicKey` + re-wrap as SPKI) so there is
  exactly one piece of stored state and no risk of the two drifting apart.
- Storage: Keychain, following the existing per-site-keyed pattern
  (`SecretAccounts.mastodonAccessToken(siteID:)`,
  `blueskyAppPassword(siteID:)`) — add
  `SecretAccounts.activityPubPrivateKeyPem(siteID:)`.
- **Generated once, lazily, inside `SocialWorkerProvisionCommand.provision()`**
  — the same place D1/R2/KV/Queue resources are created today — not at
  Workers-tab toggle-time. Toggling a worker only edits
  `SiteSettings.activeWorkerIDs`; all actual resource/secret creation happens
  during provision/deploy. The key is generated exactly once per site
  (checked via a Keychain read before generating) and never touched again on
  subsequent deploys — regenerating it would break federation trust with
  existing followers.
- Pushing the value to Cloudflare needs `wrangler secret put <NAME>`, which
  reads its value from stdin. `SocialWorkerProvisionCommand`'s wrangler calls
  don't run on the host at all — production wiring (`DeployModel`) routes
  them through `ContainerCommandRunner`, which runs `npx wrangler <args>`
  *inside the container* via `LocalContainerControl.exec` (a one-shot call
  with no stdin plumbing; that's a different seam than
  `ProcessSupervisor.attachStdin`, which is host-side and used elsewhere for
  MCP JSON-RPC framing). Since the stdin need is entirely internal to the
  guest process, it doesn't require a new interactive-exec capability: a new
  `SocialWorkerProvisionCommand.SecretRunner` closure (injected the same way
  as `runner`/`deployer`) invokes a small in-guest shell script —
  `sh -c 'printf "%s" "$WRANGLER_SECRET_VALUE" | npx wrangler secret put "$WRANGLER_SECRET_NAME"'`
  — with the secret's name and value passed only via the guest process's
  `environment` (never interpolated into the command string or argv),
  mirroring exactly how `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` already crosses into the guest
  today (`ContainerCommandRunner.guestEnvAllowlist`).

## Micropub → ActivityPub fan-out

- In `worker.ts`'s `handleMicropub`, after a successful **create** action
  (update/delete stay out of scope for v1), synthesize an internal
  `POST <actorIRI>/outbox` request carrying the `AP_PUBLISH_TOKEN` bearer
  header, and call the same `activitypub(request, env, ctx)` handler
  in-process — no network round-trip, same Worker script, same invocation
  this request is already inside.
- Content mapping: every fanned-out post becomes an AS2 `Note` (not
  `Article`) — the simplest, universally-supported choice for Mastodon
  interop — built from the Micropub post's `content`/`name` properties and
  the created post's URL (`Location` response header).
- Only fires when `AP_PUBLISH_TOKEN` is set (i.e. ActivityPub is actually
  active and provisioned) — activating Micropub alone with ActivityPub off
  never attempts to federate.
- Fan-out failure must never fail the Micropub create response (the post is
  already saved) — log and swallow, matching this file's existing
  degrade-gracefully convention.

## Testing

- `WorkerCatalogTests`: decoding the `activitypub` catalog entry — the new
  `durable-object` resource type must not break existing D1/KV/R2 decoding.
- `WorkerCompositionTests`: `generateWranglerToml` emits the
  `[[durable_objects.bindings]]` + `[[migrations]]` blocks when `activitypub`
  is active, omits them otherwise — mirrors the existing
  `hasWebmentionReceive`/`hasMicropub` test shape.
- New `ActivityPubKeyProvisioningTests`: generate a keypair, shell out to
  `openssl asn1parse`/`openssl rsa -check -noout` to confirm the PEM is valid
  PKCS#8/SPKI, and confirm the derived public key matches the private key
  (`openssl rsa -pubout` round-trip).
- `SocialWorkerProvisionCommandTests`: provisioning generates the key exactly
  once (idempotent across repeated `provision()` calls for the same site),
  and the `wrangler secret put` invocations carry the right stdin-piped
  values (via the existing fake-runner/fake-supervisor test doubles this file
  already uses for D1/R2/Queue).
- `worker.test.ts`: a new `describe("ActivityPub")` block mirroring the
  existing Micropub/Webmention groups — actor document served, 503 when
  unprovisioned, and a test that a Micropub create triggers a `Note` landing
  in the outbox.
